- The Project uses tailwindsv4 and shadcn. Use our base.css to always support dark mode and light mode in everything we create. make sure to tag all html with the correct styling classes from base.css so it respects the theme.

- my shadcn components are in the shadcn-ui folder. so reuse those when applicable when designing a page. And feel free to add new ones.

- ICONS: For anytime we use icons let use them from the package we have 'lucide-vue-next'
